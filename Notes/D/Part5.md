## What is Inheritance?

Inheritance is the ability to reuse code from a parent class in the child or subclass. More specifically, inheritance is where a more general form of class has behaviors and data which are inherited or gained by the subclass which is more specific.

## What is Abstaction?

Abstraction is an analysis effort where we've tried to find out what behaviors and data we need to design into our class. So the designer of a cat class, for example, might say, in this application I need to know the cat's name and the cat's weight and, for example, when the cat last ate.

## What is Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is making sure that the internal state, the representation of the internal state of the object, is not changed directly and is only done by sending it a message. And it's executed through a method. We cannot directly in our code be using an object directly implement, or should say directly influence or change, the internal state of an object.

## What is Polymorphism?

Polymorphism is the ability for many different objects to share behavior, receive a message for that-- for play, for example-- and each object would implement it differently. This is done automatically and is taken care of for us, making these systems more flexible and more easy to extend.

## When and How are abstaction, inheritance, polymorphism applied?

- Analysis - abstraction.
- Design - inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.
- Coding - encapsulation.

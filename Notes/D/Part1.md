# Abstraction

- The problem domain determines what subset of behavours and information you need to capture.
- Different problem domains require different behaviours, even in the same object.
- Notice how a dog's **behavior** is dependent on how it is used.

## Example: Given a Dog Object

- How does a veterinary clinic application use the Dog object?
- How does an owner application use the Dog object?
- How does a Kennel application use the Dog object?
